# Packo
Lightweight parcel management web app for apartment complexes, condos and residences with centralized parcel storage. Version 0.1.

## Objectives
* Provide a tool for leasing offices to better manage the different parcels coming to their desk
* Enhance the security of the parcel with code generation
* Negate the delay in parcel delivery and parcel returns
* Improve the pricing of supplementary services linked to parcels


## Project characteristics
The main characteristics of this project are the main base it uses which is a jsp servlets architecture. It can be called old fashioned by most but we just wanted a product that will work and that will work fast. On another note, we also used Java for development and servlet programming.

#### JSP
Java Server Page (JSP) is a technology for controlling the content or appearance of Web pages through the use of servlets, small programs that are specified in the Web page and run on the Web server to modify the Web page before it is sent to the user who requested it. Sun Microsystems, the developer of Java, also refers to the JSP technology as the Servlet application program interface (API). JSP is comparable to Microsoft's Active Server Page (ASP) technology. Whereas a Java Server Page calls a Java program that is executed by the Web server, an Active Server Page contains a script that is interpreted by a script interpreter (such as VBScript or JScript) before the page is sent to the user. For those who have a long haul experience with PHP and other scripting languages used for web development, JSP is the controller in the MVC structure of the website. The fact that it is dedicated to java web development helps for those whi have a strong experience in Java. Here is a comparison between JSP and PHP for web applications provide by Fabian Lange at the following [link](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2008/07/comparison-of-java-and-php-for-web-applications/).

#### Java
The use of Java for the backend is pretty straightforward. This language is one of the most used with one of the largest community. It was therefore pretty simple and easy to find solutions for the different problems raised during implementation. The project is mostly completed as the main functions are fully operating. 

## Project setup
The project setup is simple enough as all the libraries are included in the document. Some other libraries will be necessaries for security development and email protocols but are explained in the following part of the document. Most of programmers would already have installed Java on their machines. Also, JSP comes standard with Java, so no need for other installation. Here is the procedure to install Java at the following [link](https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml). The main required installation is the Tomcat installation. The full process is described at the following [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-16-04). 
> This is an installation procedure for Ubuntu that also works for Mac. For Windows, use this [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Tomcat-on-Windows-7).

## Join the discussion group

You can join the discussion group of the project at the link [https://discord.gg/xDwbYMb](https://discord.gg/xDwbYMb). Don't hesitate to propose new ideas and concepts. I hope this project will grow steadily and help many residences to manage their parcels in the most efficient way possible.
